# wkesni

A well-known URI for publishing ECHConfigList values from a web server.
The [Internet draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-wkech) 
was recently adopted by the IETF TLS WG.

[This](draft-ietf-tls-wkech.txt) is the local copy. 

[wkech-02.sh](wkech-02.sh) is a bash script that implements (most of) the draft.
That has a bunch of dependencies, and is a work-in-progress, so don't use it - it's
for testing!
